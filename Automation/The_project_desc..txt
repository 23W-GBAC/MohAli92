# let's create a simple example of an automation script related to healthcare. Let's focus on an appointment reminder system using Python and a fictional messaging service. For the sake of this example, we'll use a console-based script. Note that in a real-world scenario, you would likely integrate with a messaging API or a service like Twilio for sending actual messages.

In this script:

AppointmentReminder class represents an appointment reminder for a specific patient.
generate_random_datetime function simulates generating a random appointment datetime within the next 7 days.
The main function iterates through a list of appointments, creates an AppointmentReminder object for each, and sends a reminder.
Remember, this is a basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would likely need to integrate with a messaging service API, handle errors, and possibly use a database to store appointment information. Always ensure compliance with healthcare regulations and patient privacy laws when working with healthcare data.
